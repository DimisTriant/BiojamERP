# BiojamERP  
### Java-based ERP System for an Organic Jam Company

BiojamERP is a Java-based ERP system developed as part of a university programming course.  
The project focuses on the **analysis, design, and implementation of a complete information system** for a small organic jam manufacturing company, addressing real operational and data-related challenges.



## Project Overview

The Biojam company faces multiple operational inefficiencies, including:
- Inconsistent inventory management (stockouts and overstocking)
- Manual order handling and limited process automation
- Lack of real-time visibility into production and sales
- Limited support for data-driven decision making

BiojamERP was designed to simulate a centralized ERP solution that improves process efficiency, data consistency, and managerial insight.



## System Scope & Features

The system supports core ERP functionalities such as:
- Order registration and approval
- Inventory and stock level monitoring
- Production tracking
- Customer and supplier management
- Basic reporting and summaries

The project follows a structured system development lifecycle, including preparation, analysis, design, and implementation phases.



## Data & Process Analysis

The system is based on:
- **AS-IS and TO-BE business process analysis**
- Business Process Improvement (BPI) and selective Business Process Automation (BPA)
- User stories and use cases derived from realistic operational scenarios

Key data entities modeled in the system:
- Orders
- Products
- Inventory
- Suppliers
- Customers

These entities form a structured data foundation suitable for future analytics and optimization.



## System Design & Implementation

- **Language:** Java (console-based application)
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming
- **Modeling:** UML (Use Case, Class, Sequence, Activity diagrams)
- **Tools:** Visual Paradigm, Eclipse IDE

The implementation follows the final class diagram and supports the primary business workflows defined during the analysis phase.



## Project Management & Collaboration

This project was developed as a **team-based academic project** and includes:
- Defined team roles and responsibilities
- Project planning and scheduling
- Meeting agendas, minutes, and timesheets
- Progress monitoring and coordination

This ensured structured collaboration and controlled project execution.



## Personal Contribution

- Business and system requirements analysis  
- Modeling of business processes and system workflows  
- UML design (Class and Sequence diagrams)  
- Java implementation of core ERP functionality  
- Contribution to documentation and system validation  



## Documentation

- Full analytical report (~80 pages)
- Complete UML documentation
- Java source code included in the project archive

> **Note:**  
> The main documentation is written in Greek, as the project was developed within the context of a university course.



## Analytics & AI Perspective (Future Extensions)

While the current implementation is rule-based, the system was designed with data-driven decision support in mind.  
Potential future extensions include:
- Demand forecasting based on historical order data
- Inventory optimization and anomaly detection
- Supplier performance analysis
- KPI dashboards and business intelligence reporting
